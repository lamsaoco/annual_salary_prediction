Problem:
In the recruitment process, HR professionals often encounter candidates with diverse profiles. After successfully passing multiple interview rounds, candidates typically reach the most crucial stage — the salary negotiation. At this point, many candidates choose not to disclose their previous salary, which creates challenges for HR in determining a fair and competitive offer. Offering too low a salary might cause the candidate to decline, while offering too high may exceed the company’s budget constraints.

To address this issue, this machine learning model aims to predict a candidate’s annual salary based on publicly available profile information such as previous department, past job title, years of experience, and other relevant features.
The model can assist HR teams in making more data-driven and informed compensation decisions, ensuring both candidate satisfaction and budget alignment.
